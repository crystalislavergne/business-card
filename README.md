When creating my card, I was faced with many issues. My main issue was in regard to Github, it took me a few weeks until I was able to properly upload my live site and even then I had issues with my assets loading properly. With this first lesson, I learned that coding is not my strong suit. I was able to grasp the smaller elements and how they work together but I had difficulty when trying to piece each section together. I had a lot of help from Lara when it came to resizing and troubleshooting. When coding, the smallest mistake can cause a chain reaction. I learned this when one of my linked websites wasn't working and the issue was that I was a single letter off of the correct code. All in all, this was a great first assignment. I believe that if I put more time into learning how to code I can be proficient at it but the first few weeks were not long enough for me personally.
